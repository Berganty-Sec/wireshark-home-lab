#Project: Wireshark Home Lab Investigation

##Objective:
Capture and analyze network traffic to identify:
- Accessed websites
- Network Protocols in use
- External communication endpoints

##Environment:
- Windows 10
- Wireshark
- Home network

##Results:
- Accessed domains: google.com, youtube.com, github.com
- Observed protocols: DNS, TCP, TLS
- Detected communication with multiple external servers

##Conclusion:
The packet analysis made it possible to identify the host’s browsing behavior. Network traffic inspection using Wireshark proved effective for understanding user activity, protocol usage, and external communications.
